numbers.shape: (3, 22425600)  (for channel mean/std)
mean(numbers): [107.04831643 102.66479564 105.59662141]
std(numbers):  [109.82162089 112.29766834 114.25086572]

But, use this for actual mean/std because we want them in [0,256) ...
mean(scaled): [0.41979732 0.40260704 0.4141044 ]
std(scaled):  [0.43067302 0.44038301 0.44804261]
