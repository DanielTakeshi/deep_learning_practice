# TF Practice

**TODO: upgrade to TensorFlow 2.0+ and PyTorch 1.0+, respectively.**

Well, originally it was for TensorFlow practice. Now I have practiced with:

- Theano (not using it anymore)
- Keras (use `tf.keras` now)
- TensorFlow (TODO: eager execution)
- PyTorch (TODO: understand everything)

Mostly with Python3, but some projects really require Python2, bleh.

For robotics projects, those usually involve Python 2.7. I am using Torch 0.4.1.
(Edit: well, now 1.0.0 or higher)
